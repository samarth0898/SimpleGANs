## SimpleGANs 

GAN : Generative Adversarial Networks 

PyTorch implementations of simple GANS including: 
- Gaussian Distribtion based GAN 
- Pokemon GAN (PokeGAN)


### Pokemon GAN 

This is based on a DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN) to generate photorealistic images of novel pokemons from our training dataset [2].
